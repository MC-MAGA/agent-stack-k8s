## Prohibiting the Kubernetes plugin (v0.13.0 and later)

Suppose you want to enforce the podSpec used for all jobs at the controller
level, and prevent users from setting or overriding that podSpec (or various
other parameters) through use of the kubernetes plugin.
This can be achieved with `prohibit-kubernetes-plugin`, either as a controller
flag or within the config `values.yaml`:

```yaml
# values.yaml
...
config:
  prohibit-kubernetes-plugin: true
  pod-spec-patch:
    # Override the default podSpec here.
  ...
```

With `prohibit-kubernetes-plugin` enabled, any job containing the kubernetes
plugin will fail.
